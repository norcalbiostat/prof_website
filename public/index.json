Basic life support (BLS) skills decline rapidly without frequent practice. Deliberate practice (DP) and simulation scenarios have been shown to increase BLS skill retention for nursing students. Additionally, BLS implementation in the hospital setting requires effective team skills which are infrequently addressed in resuscitation courses or in nursing students' practice. An exploratory study to determine the impact of recurrent simulations with deliberate practice on BLS team skills was designed for senior nursing students. Methods. Seven teams of students were followed over the course of one semester examining the impact of deliberate practice in recurrent simulation codes on BLS team skills. Results. Students attained effective BLS team performance after three hours of deliberate practice, and sustained these skills over the semester with recurrent code practice. Conclusion. Recurring code team DP sustains BLS skills and is recommended for nursing students.","tags":["nursing-simulation"],"title":"Deliberate practice in simulation - Evaluation of repetitive code training on nursing students' BLS team skills","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Still need to figure out the docs structure OMG ALL DOCS ARE LINKED TOGETHER.\nWORSE - the title of the page is directly generated from the folder name..

Twelve high schools in areas with STD and pregnancy rates exceeding the Healthy People 2010 [14] goals were matched into six pairs based on criteria including chlamydia and birth rates, school demographics, and number of students, and were invited to participate. To minimize contamination between conditions, the schools in each pair were purposively assigned to either the intervention or control condition so that no intervention school attendance area shared a geographic boundary with any control school. Schools were matched using publicly available data before any staff contact with school personnel.\nKeeping It Real LAC (2010 -2015) Funded through the Office of Adolescent Health, Keeping It Real LAC (KIR) trained 7th and 8th grade teachers in 24 CUSD and LAUSD middle schools in the evidence-based, abstinence-plus curriculum It‚Äôs Your Game‚Ä¶Keep It Real! (IYG). KIR demonstrated that, with appropriate training and support, middle school teachers are capable of delivering evidence-based sexual health education that impacts student risk behaviors.

I\u0026rsquo;m taking a full year sabbatical, and so I wanted to start by doing some updates to this site first. This post is a chronicle of my journey, mostly for my reference but also hopefully can help others. Technically I started tinkering about a week ago, but for the most part this post will be my \u0026lsquo;real time\u0026rsquo; thoughts and experiments. Edit: This is also serving as a self-reference \u0026ldquo;how did I do that?\u0026quot;\nList of tutorials that helped me  \rAcademic theme documentation Allison hill - Summer of blogdown A community of users  Start: Updating engines Update all the things!\n Hugo: That\u0026rsquo;s easy, blogdown::update_hugo gets me the latest and greatest, version 0.71.1 Updating the academic theme \u0026ndash; not so easy. Had to start from scratch, but that seems to be typical. Hard lesson learned, don\u0026rsquo;t wait 3 years to update. R Studio just came out with 1.3, AND R released 4.0.0 in April. Get those also.  Start customization (slowly) The documentation has been the best starting resource https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/get-started/. I want through it slowly, to make sure i\u0026rsquo;m learning how this new theme fits together. Because FOR SURE the Academic theme is at least twice as complicated as it was 3 years ago.\nTop level root The only file to customize here is config.toml, and not much to do in here. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I changed:\n title: this shows up in the top left of the navbar, and your browser tab. copyright: shows up at the bottom of every post \u0026amp; project post url: I came across some post, i can\u0026rsquo;t recall where it now, that suggested a change to the URL for posts. The default was something like /post/:year-:month-:day-:slug/:slug - where there was a separate folder for the slug. I don\u0026rsquo;t recall exactly, but here\u0026rsquo;s a note from the blogdown book  More top level configuration config/_default/  languages.toml didn\u0026rsquo;t need to change as i\u0026rsquo;m boring old plain english menus.toml Navbar! Comment out everything I don\u0026rsquo;t need, change the order that it appears using weights.  See here for dropdown menu items     ‚ùì How to right justify?\n  params.toml More to do here.  Theme: Green of course. Don\u0026rsquo;t care about font face, but I went with the slightly smaller text (\u0026lsquo;M\u0026rsquo;) Basic info: Left most of this alone, but specified site_type = \u0026quot;Person\u0026quot; Site features: didn\u0026rsquo;t change these. May do so later. Probably for the edit pages part. It depends on if I end up pulling my course materials over. Contact details: updated all of this Social: Just added Twitter name Regional: changed to 24 hour time - personal preference. Advanced: Updated copyright_license to add a creative commons license since I post course materials and code. Comments: disabled for now. Search: defaults are fine Maps: defaults are fine Marketing: default CMS: default     ‚ùì What\u0026rsquo;s the privacy pack? This site sets cookies? Need to look more into what this does.\n Introduce yourself The content/authors/admin/_index.md file controls the \u0026lsquo;About me\u0026rsquo; section of the page. It has your avatar on the left, social icons underneath and a spot to the right for a paragraph of info.\n You can\u0026rsquo;t do markdown style links, but you can display URLs. As you add more social icons to the space below your mugshot, the sizes automatically get smaller. Would be nice to have the option to wrap onto a second line. The avatar.jpg goes in the same folder. If you want an icon to show on your browser tab, put icon.png in assets\\images.  Host on Netlify I don\u0026rsquo;t recall where along this process I pushed to git and deployed on Netlify. It was for sure before i got too far down the customization rabbit hole. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to specify your hugo build - mine was 0.70.0 (need that last decimal).\nRemove widgets Unlike the \u0026lsquo;delete all the things\u0026rsquo; approach that Danielle Navarro takes, i\u0026rsquo;d rather just turn them off.\nInside the content/home directory, there\u0026rsquo;s all these .md files. Each one is a widget, and by default most of these are set to active=true. I turned most of them off, but I may turn some back on later. Supposedly you can have widgets enabled on other pages, not just this landing/home page. I\u0026rsquo;ll look into that later. Baby steps, start small then add incrementally. Like a ggplot, layer it on.\nAdding content Projects I already had a blogdown site that included projects. Migrating those over to this new format wasn\u0026rsquo;t terrible.\n Under /content/project, each project has it\u0026rsquo;s own folder.  Within each folder there is an index.md file.  Each index.md file has a large YAML header section,     Modify the content/home/projects.md file to  set the [[content.filter_button]] to add tag filters set the display of projects (cards vs lists)    Courses Previously, I simply had separate \u0026lsquo;simple\u0026rsquo; RMarkdown websites for my class pages [ex Math 130], and I linked to them from my main page. However, Academic has a whole different page layout called docs for writing and sharing documentation, such as course materials.\n  In content/courses, there\u0026rsquo;s an overall _index.md which is pretty plain, has the docs layout (which i gather is the important part) but this is where you can add some introductory text. that would apply to all courses.\n  Each course has it\u0026rsquo;s own folder, which of course has their own _index.md files. These will automatically show up on the courses page, with a short summary that you specify in the course specific index md file.\n  ‚ùì Can i add direct links to these courses as a drop down in the navbar?\nThe only thing i\u0026rsquo;ve done here so far is setup placeholder entries for 2 of my classes.\nBlog posts This is about when I decided I needed to document what I was doing, and started this blog post. I did so by using the RStudio Addin, New Post. While most of the writing is just text, I opted for a .Rmarkdown file.\n‚ùì What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between .Rmd and .Rmarkdown\nR code still works right?\n2+2\r ## [1] 4\r Okay, i\u0026rsquo;m tossing the blog posts that came along with the example/template files. Before I migrate my old posts over, time to re-read the \u0026lsquo;Spoonful of Hugo\u0026rsquo; post by Allison Hill on page bundles. Because there was something about the way posts are handled that is different from \u0026lsquo;old\u0026rsquo; Hugo.\nAh! This is where I got the info about the slug from!\nAttempt 1.\n Make a new folder using the YYYY-MM-DD-slug format, and put my old .Rmd file into this folder, renaming it as index.Rmd. Copy the YAML material from this page into that one. Won\u0026rsquo;t render \u0026ndash; because i was doing things with data and that data was stored under ../../static/data/.. which is what the page bundles are designed to deal with.  Move data into folder where the rmd file is at, and update path. This would be a HUGE PAIN if I had a lot of these\u0026hellip;   Worked! okay.. not bad at all.  Attempt 2. Too many manual steps above.\n Copy .md/.Rmd into content/post. Make a new folder Use copy/paste magic to rename folder the same as the prior post Rename content file index Use Rstudio Addin to Update Metadata  Serve site and\u0026hellip; well turns out you don\u0026rsquo;t even need that last step. Okay better. Posts are done.\nPage features  Turn off profile blurb that shows at the bottom of each post. Not necessary/desired for a single author page. You can also toggle off reading_time, shareing links, commentable and editable.  ‚ùó You -can- Knit your .Rmd file to see what it looks like while working on it, just delete it before you save. It\u0026rsquo;ll get re-rendered when you build site, in the \u0026lsquo;proper\u0026rsquo; format that\u0026rsquo;s needed for display on a Hugo based website.\n ‚ùì Each post has a \u0026ldquo;last updated on\u0026rdquo;, and it\u0026rsquo;s the date i \u0026lsquo;created\u0026rsquo; the file - which in the case of this website update it\u0026rsquo;s saying June 11, 2020. That\u0026rsquo;s not the date i want to show. I\u0026rsquo;ve messed with the date and the lastmod date in the YAML header.. i\u0026rsquo;ve tried quotes and no quotes, i\u0026rsquo;ve tried updating the metadata. Nothing.\n Publications Interesting change. Before, this was just a folder containing one .md file per pub. The Academic theme now has three subfolders, conference-paper, journal-article and preprint. The examples for each are really good to keep, so I \u0026ldquo;commented out\u0026rdquo; each pub by renaming index.md to _index.md and changed the folder name to example-\n ‚ùì - this doesn\u0026rsquo;t remove it from the citation list. If you do the \u0026lsquo;filter by pubs\u0026rsquo; they still show up. Hmm, how is this list built?\n For now i\u0026rsquo;m going to edit the content/home/publications.md to remove the alert note. While i\u0026rsquo;m here, i\u0026rsquo;m also modifying the view to a \u0026lsquo;card\u0026rsquo; view.. not list.

Additional Content/Sections I want to work on adding sections for the following areas.\n Academic Advising (blog post template)  General info on letter of reference requests Statistics/DS program guide Academic life? Choosing graduate school?   Project advising (project template)  A place to showcase the work students are doing Highlights the students work Acts as a recruitment tool for prospective students. MS students: committee member only? - This could get really big.    Making a new section I want a section on the homepage for teaching. I think I\u0026rsquo;m okay with just having a list like my old site, so I just copied content/home/demo.md, renamed it as teaching.md, then copied the content in from the old site widget.\n Going to need subpages for this. Courses/Notebook/Data/Workshops\u0026hellip;  Featured images You\u0026rsquo;d think that adding a link to image into this section of the header would work, but no.\nheader:\rcaption: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\rimage:  Add this to the header instead.\nimage:\rplacement: 1\rcaption: \u0026quot;test\u0026quot;\r Read more here.\nAdding a student page I did this using by creating a new widget page\n Make new folder under content/ called students/. Add index.md Move the people.md widget out of home/ into students/ Each person gets a folder under /content/authors - and is assigned to a user_group.  This display is adjusted in the people.md file.   add a weight: \u0026lt;number\u0026gt; to the header after title to control order. ref  In closing That\u0026rsquo;s it for now.

When we first start out, we often write an R script with all of the work, and would just send emails to collaborators, describing the results and attaching various graphs. In discussing the results, there often can be confusion about which graph was which. Moving to writing formal reports, with Word or LaTeX, there is still much time spent on getting the figures to look right. Mostly, the concern is about page breaks and generating reproducible results. Imagine the work that has to be done to find the right analysis code to fix a problem in a report generated 4 years ago on an old data set, that you hope you can still find. Ideally, such analysis reports are reproducible documents: If an error is discovered, or if some additional subjects are added to the data, you can just re-compile the report and get the new or corrected results (versus having to reconstruct figures, paste them into a Word document, and further hand-edit various detailed results). This workshop will walk you through a key package in R called knitr, that is the leading solution to these types of reports. It allows you to create a document that is a mixture of text and chunks of code. When the document is processed by knitr, chunks of code will be executed, and graphs or other results inserted into a professional looking final document. Reports can be created in many formats such as Word, PDF or as HTML webpages, and are highly customizable.

Data entry is time consuming and expensive. This research explored using convolutional neural networks (CNN, a deep learning process) to automate the data entry of thousands of surveys administered as part of a college program assessment. CNN are used in image detection (e.g. is there a cute cat in the picture?), where digital images are stored as arrays with entries corresponding to pixel color. CNN‚Äôs are constructed by creating many layers that each apply specific matrix operations to extract the most salient characteristics in the image. Our work differs from image detection; our goal was to identify where a mark exists on a page (e.g. circles, x‚Äôs), and classify it as the corresponding response. Like other machine learning models, CNN depend on quality and quantity of training data, and can be computationally intensive but feasible on a moderate powered server. Preliminary results achieved 92% validation accuracy, demonstrating it‚Äôs feasible to use paper surveys without the burden of manual data entry or costly software licenses.\nStudent Researcher  \rKris Walker  Presentations Kris presented his work in the Student Poster Session at the 2020 Joint Math Meetings, January 15-18, 2020, Denver, CO.\n","date":1559088000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594421586,"objectID":"cbe0c24c174e9c23efd27e59e7e56acc","permalink":"/project/cnn/","publishdate":"2019-05-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cnn/","section":"project","summary":"Using Convolutional Neural Networks as a method of automatic data entry of PDF paper surveys","tags":["Data-Science","Featured"],"title":"Deep Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic \rAcademic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click \rPDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions? \rAsk\n\rDocumentation\n","date":1549324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590804627,"objectID":"0e6de1a61aa83269ff13324f3167c1a9","permalink":"/slides/example/","publishdate":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/slides/example/","section":"slides","summary":"An introduction to using Academic's Slides feature.","tags":[],"title":"Slides","type":"slides"},{"authors":["Nissen, J.","Donatello, RA.","Van Dusen, B."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546992000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592798139,"objectID":"b01d0c7ed256528b33fb377401fbfe97","permalink":"/publication/mi_per/","publishdate":"2019-07-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mi_per/","section":"publication","summary":"Physics education researchers (PER) commonly use complete-case analysis to address missing data. For complete-case analysis, researchers discard all data from any student who is missing any data. Despite its frequent use, no PER article we reviewed that used complete-case analysis provided evidence that the analyzed data met the assumptions necessary to ensure accurate results with complete-case analysis. Not meeting these assumptions raises the possibility that prior studies have reported biased results with inflated gains that may obscure differences across courses. To test this possibility, we used simulated data to compare the accuracy of complete-case analysis and multiple imputation (MI). PER studies seldom use MI, but MI uses all available data, has less stringent assumptions, and is more accurate and more statistically powerful than complete-case analysis. Results indicated that complete-case analysis introduced more bias than MI and this bias was large enough to obscure differences between student populations or between courses. We recommend that the PER community adopt the use of MI for handling missing data to improve the accuracy in research studies.","tags":["physics education","missing data","MICE"],"title":"Missing data and bias in physics education research; A case for using multiple imputation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["efficiency","programming"],"content":"\rI had a student (Jack Fogliasso) bring me a problem from a Microbiology lab where they are trying to identify bacteria using lasers.

For over a century, these delicate structures have fascinated microbiologists and geoscientists. Because L. ochracea still resists long-term in vitro culture, the debate regarding its metabolic classification dates back to 1885. We developed a novel culturing technique for L. ochracea using in situ natural waters and coupled this with single-cell genomics and nanoscale secondary-ion mass spectrophotometry (nanoSIMS) to probe L. ochracea‚Äôs physiology. In microslide cultures L. ochracea doubled every 5.7 h and had an absolute growth requirement for ferrous iron, the genomic capacity for iron oxidation, and a branched electron transport chain with cytochromes putatively involved in lithotrophic iron oxidation. Additionally, its genome encoded several electron transport chain proteins, including a molybdopterin alternative complex III (ACIII), a cytochrome bd oxidase reductase, and several terminal oxidase genes. L. ochracea contained two key autotrophic proteins in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, a form II ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, and a phosphoribulose kinase. L. ochracea also assimilated bicarbonate, although calculations suggest that bicarbonate assimilation is a small fraction of its total carbon assimilation. Finally, L. ochracea‚Äôs fundamental physiology is a hybrid of those of the chemolithotrophic Gallionella-type ironoxidizing bacteria and the sheathed, heterotrophic filamentous metal-oxidizing bacteria of the Leptothrix-Sphaerotilus genera. This allows L. ochracea to inhabit a unique niche within the neutrophilic iron seeps. IMPORTANCE Leptothrix ochracea was one of three groups of organisms that Sergei Winogradsky used in the 1880s to develop the hypothesis on chemolithotrophy. L. ochracea continues to resist cultivation and appears to have an absolute requirement for organic rich waters, suggesting that its true physiology remains unknown. Further, L. ochracea is an ecological engineer; a few L. ochracea cells can generate prodigious volumes of iron oxyhydroxides, changing the ecosystem‚Äôs geochemistry and ecology. Therefore, to determine L. ochracea‚Äôs basic physiology, we employed new single-cell techniques to demonstrate that L. ochracea oxidizes iron to generate energy and, despite having predicted genes for autotrophic growth, assimilates a fraction of the total CO2 that autotrophs do. Although not a true chemolithoautotroph, L. ochracea‚Äôs physiological strategy allows it to be flexible and to extensively colonize iron-rich wetlands.","tags":["biology"],"title":"Insights into the fundamental physiology of the uncultured FE-oxidizing bacterium Leptothrix ochracea","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["programming"],"content":"Overview Instructions and links for downloading and installing the R Studio suite of awesomeness.

Guide courtesy of Justin Bankes (2017).\nR Studio - A tour Initial Start When you first (like very first time) open R studio you will see three panels. Console The console is the full panel on the left  Everytime you launch RStudio, it will have the same text at the top of the console telling you the version of R that you\u0026rsquo;re running. Below that information is the prompt, \u0026gt; . As its name suggests, this prompt is really a request, a request for a command. Initially, interacting with R is all about typing commands and interpreting the output. These commands and their syntax have evolved over decades (literally) and now provide what many users feel is a fairly natural way to access data and organize, describe, and invoke statistical computations.  The console is where you type commands and have them immediately performed.\nEnvironment The panel in the upper right contains your workspace (aka Environment)\n This shows you a list of objects/variables that R has saved. For example here a value of 3 has been assigned to the object a.  History Up here there is an additional tab to see the history of the commands that you\u0026rsquo;ve previously entered.\nFiles The files tab allows you to open code/script files within R studio.\nPlots Any plots that you generate will show up in the panel in the lower right corner.\nGetting Help To check the syntax of any function in R, type ? in front of the function name to pull up the help file.\nFor example here I typed ?mean to get the help file for the mean function. Admittedly these aren\u0026rsquo;t the most helpful of files at times. This is where Google / stack overflow / R help list serves and R user groups can be your friend.\nScript file (a.k.a code file)  Most often your R studio window will have 4 panels. The top left is your editor window, where you write code or script, the console is now at the bottom. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s minimized, you can use the boxes in the top right corner of the console window to bring up the console.  When we type R code in a specific way up here, the results show up both right below the code you just typed, and in the console itself.\n2+2\r Setting Preferences to retain sanity R Studio Preferences To avoid some of the most common errors when learning R let\u0026rsquo;s set some preferences in RStudio.\n On your computer, create a folder for your specific course in an easy to locate place.  Recommended paths are short, such as C:/School/R or ~/rdonatello/School/MATH315 You will store all files associated with this class here. Do not use any spaces in the folder name, and keep it simple.    Finding your path on a Mac  Select the file or folder in the OS X Finder, then hit Command+i to summon Get Info Get Info can also be accessed by the control-click and right-click menus. Click and drag alongside \u0026ldquo;Where\u0026rdquo; to select the path, then hit Command+C to copy the full path to the clipboard Paste this into R for your path. Make sure all slashes are forward slashes /.  Mac Reference link: http://bit.ly/1NxF9eu\nFinding your path on Windows  Open Windows Explorer and browse to the folder or file of your choice. The path to the folder/file will be indicated in the Address bar of Windows Explorer. To copy it, simply right-click on the Address bar and select Copy address as text. Paste this into R for your path. Make sure all slashes are forward slashes /.  Windows Reference link: http://bit.ly/1NxFeir\nR Studio Preferences Continuing with the R Studio preferences,\nIn RStudio the file menu go to Tools then Global Options. Uncheck \u0026ldquo;Restore .RData into workspace at startup\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Always save history\u0026rdquo; Where it says \u0026lsquo;Save workspace to .RData on exit:\u0026quot; Select \u0026lsquo;Never\u0026rsquo; Click apply then ok.  R packages: How things get done. Installing R Packages Packages are sets of predefined code, functions and data sets. They provide additional functionality and goodies beyond what is included when you download Base R.\n  Packages are only installed once per computer (until you update R).\n  To install the knitr package type the following command at the prompt \u0026gt; and hit enter to submit the command.\n  install.packages(\u0026quot;knitr\u0026quot;)\r  Repeat the above to install the following packages, remembering R is case sensitive: rmarkdown, kableExtra, gridExtra, tidyverse, knitr, nycflights13 and hflights.  Installing R Packages - Shortcut You can install multiple packages at once by combining the list of package names using the collection operator c().\ninstall.packages(c(\u0026quot;rmarkdown\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;gridExtra\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;kableExtra\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;knitr\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;nycflights13\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;hflights\u0026quot;))\r LaTeX - professional reporting Make nice PDF reports and presentations. LaTeX allows you to turn your reports into a nicely formatted PDF document.\n Install once and forget about it.  Download from: https://www.latex-project.org/get/\n Windows: I have had best luck with proTeXt Suck it up and get the 2G download for less headache later. (Don\u0026rsquo;t do this on the campus wifi during class time.)  You can edit *tex files directly in R Studio, a separate tex editor is not necessary.\nR Commander: Pointing and clicking your way along A Basic Statistics GUI for R \r\rAdditional setup for R Commander  Install via the Rcmdr package. Website: http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/ You will need to install Pandoc converter engine if you want to create PDF output as Rcmdr uses the old markdown package which only can create HTML output.  More help For more help and/or places to start learning, I would recommend starting with the resources R Studio already has curated for you. https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/\n","date":1501977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593046391,"objectID":"c0fcf4676509a59204dcf21d5c9f7462","permalink":"/post/2017-08-06-software-overview/","publishdate":"2017-08-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-08-06-software-overview/","section":"post","summary":"Overview Instructions and links for downloading and installing the R Studio suite of awesomeness.

The purpose of this study was to determine if a school-based structural intervention focused on school nurses increases receipt of condoms and SRH information among male students. Methods. Interventions to improve student access to sexual and reproductive health care were implemented in six urban high schools with a matched set of comparison schools. Interventions included working with school nurses to improve access to sexual and reproductive health care, including the provision of condoms and information about pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease prevention and services. Intervention effects were assessed through five cross-sectional yearly surveys, and analyses include data from 13,740 male students. Results. Nurses in intervention schools changed their interactions with male students who visited them for services, such that, among those who reported they went to the school nurse for any reason in the previous year, those in intervention schools reported significant increases in receipt of sexual health services over the course of the study compared with students in comparison schools. Further, these results translated into population-level effects. Among all male students surveyed, those in intervention schools were more likely than those in comparison schools to report increases in receipt of sexual health services from school nurses. Conclusions. With a minimal investment of resources, school nurses can become important sources of SRH information and condoms for male high school students.","tags":["public-health","teen-pregnancy-prevention"],"title":"Structural Intervention With School Nurses Increases Receipt of Sexual Health Care Among Male High School Students","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["professional"],"content":"As a teacher, i\u0026rsquo;m on a 9 month contract. That means technically I don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; over summer. However as any academic can tell you, that\u0026rsquo;s not how it goes. Everyone works over summer, it\u0026rsquo;s just what they work on (and when they work on it) is more of a personal preference. Some get grants and work with students, some are busy working in the labs to advance their own research. Some even decide to teach summer school (I\u0026rsquo;m not quite that crazy yet). All of us eventually have to start to get their lesson plans going for the fall. It creeps up on you faster than you realize!\nFor me, my summer schedule consists of morning gardening, little time on video games, responding to the easy emails, assessing any mandatory chores my nephews may have to do for the day and then hard coding what i\u0026rsquo;m going to spend my energy on today. I always have a plethora of projects going on. This summer I have three consulting projects, writing a book chapter, editing a manuscript, two websites to redesign and eventually update lecture notes and course webpages for Fall. My pokemon for today was to work on the website(s).\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been playing with building personal and project websites for a while. Years ago I started with WordPress, but was disenchanted with it pretty fast (Years and years ago I wrote html directly, but that was like baby coding 1.0). Then I moved to using Rmarkdown (rmd) files with manual links between pages to build my course website - hosting them in Git Hub. Worked well but very limited, always forgetting to push updates before class, broken links (damn case sensitivity).\nRecently I used R Studio to build an entire website to display an e-portfolio for a Sustaining Success project for a Course Redesign in a first semester Chemistry class. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty damned happy with it. You can see this work here\nStill not good enough for a fully academic website. I\u0026rsquo;ve been eyeballing varying themes and sites using Jekyll for over a year, never fully getting one implemented. Something either just wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite right or didn\u0026rsquo;t work well with my workflow.\nThen along comes blogdown. Extremely happy with what Yihui Xie has been doing with Rmarkdown in general I watched a webinar and was sold on trying it.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been pretty much following Alison Presmanes Hill\u0026rsquo;s walk through. Needless to say i\u0026rsquo;m currently on section 6.5.2: New markdown posts ;) So far this has been really easy and straight forward to implement.\nSo, post #1 done. Moving on to section 7: Deploy in Netlify. Yet another new program/site/thing to learn but i\u0026rsquo;m excited and I think it\u0026rsquo;ll be easy. Can\u0026rsquo;t wait to see this new site live!\n","date":1499472000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593046391,"objectID":"a45acfaa5b99d7d859384089a7112064","permalink":"/post/2017-07-08-new-website-using-blogdown/","publishdate":"2017-07-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017-07-08-new-website-using-blogdown/","section":"post","summary":"As a teacher, i\u0026rsquo;m on a 9 month contract.

Lifetime experiences with vaginal and oral sex were most common (19% and 16%, respectively); fewer reported anal sex (6%). Of the 23% reporting any sex, 91% fell into four categories- 36% reporting both oral and vaginal sex; 23% vaginal only; 18% all three; and 13% oral only. Most sexually experienced students (88%) initiated with vaginal or oral sex (46% vaginal, 33% oral, 9% both same day). No dominant pathway of sexual onset emerged for those reporting all three types of sex. We found no evidence that oral or anal sex substituted for or delayed vaginal sex. Males, those with a current partner, and those reporting multiple partners were more likely than others to report all three sexual behaviors versus vaginal only (odds ratios [ORs] 2.0, 1.5, 3.0; p = .02, .06, ","tags":["public-health","teen-pregnancy-prevention"],"title":"Patterns of Sexual Experience Among Urban Latino and African American Ninth Grade Students","type":"publication"}]
