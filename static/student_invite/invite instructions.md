Hello and thank you for allowing me to showcase your work on my website. 
There are two spots where this information will show
1. A brief intro - https://www.norcalbiostat.com/students/
2. Your own page - click on any person to see their page. 

Each entry below surrounded by `< >` is a place for you to provide your information. 
Please remove the `< >` once you are done. 
Mind the spacing/indenting. This is important for the markdown to render correctly. 

* courses: Each course is a degree program. You can copy/paste this information to add a second course (such as DS certificate or a minor)
* interests: Limit 3-4 for space. At most 1 personal, the rest professional or a topic area of interest (like sports)
* role: <Put your current academic program here>
* social: Optional icons that show up under your picture. Remove any you don't use.
* avatar: Send me a headshot/avatar you want me to use for your picture. Please name this file `avatar.jpg` (other image types also okay)
