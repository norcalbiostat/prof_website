# Coding is a social activity!
Never code alone :)


* Got data and working on analysis? 
* Got questions on using R or other programming languages? 
* Great way to dedicate time to working on that project you've been meaning to get around to. 

Come and hang out with other coders in a welcoming and supportive environment.
