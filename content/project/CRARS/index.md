In the face of global climate change, we at the CSU, Chico Center for Regenerative Agriculture and Resilient Systems (CRARS) seek to promote regenerative farming practices to reduce greenhouse gasses, restore soil resiliency, increase the sustainability of farms and ranches, and address food and water insecurity.

I collaborate closely with CRARS staff to enhance, organize and streamline the data related processes related to work done across multiple projects. This work involves facilitating the development of a structured and streamlined system for data storage and analysis, ensuring data quality, accessibility, and usability across multiple projects, stakeholders, and PIs.
