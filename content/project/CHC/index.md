As a member of the [Data Science Initiative](http://datascience.csuchico.edu), I have been working with the [Center for Healthy Communties](https://www.csuchico.edu/chc/) since 2019 as a statistical consultant, data manager, providing data skills training workshops and managing Data Science student interns. I help the CHC streamline and organize their data processes, research and program evaluation tasks. 

The primary contract that I work on is the **CalFresh Outreach Program**

CalFresh Food is a nutrition assistance program that helps low-income individuals and families buy the food they need. CalFresh Food dollars help stretch a tight food budget and help many people afford to incorporate healthy foods like fruits and vegetables into their diets.
