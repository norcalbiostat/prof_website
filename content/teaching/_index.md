### [Data](data/)
Wherever possible I try to use real world, non pre-processed data in the classroom. The [Data](data/) page provides links to download data, codebooks where available, and code to import these data sets into R. 

### [Practical Multivariate Analysis 6th edition](https://www.routledge.com/Practical-Multivariate-Analysis/Afifi-May-Donatello-Clark/p/book/9781032088471)
I co-authored the newest edition of this textbook. Dr. Afifi was my instructor in graduate school and I learned from teh 4th edition, taught from both the 5th and 6th. I maintain the [supplemental materials website](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/pma6_code/). 

### [Applied Statistics Notebook](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/AppliedStatistics_notes/)
A compilation of Applied Statistics lecture notes using [[Bookdown]](https://bookdown.org/) that I use in multiple classes. Most of the examples are in R, some SPSS instructions or links to SPSS help pages sprinkled throughout. 

### Other
Link other notes and helper files such as how to do things in R, how to write posters, how to read journal articles here. Or in it's own folder below?
