### [Data](data/)
Wherever possible I try to use real world, non pre-processed data in the classroom. The [Data](data/) page provides links to download data, codebooks where available, and code to import these data sets into R. 

### [Applied Statistics Notebook](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/AppliedStatistics_notes/)
A compilation of Applied Statistics lecture notes using [[Bookdown]](https://bookdown.org/) that I use in multiple classes. Most of the examples are in R, some SPSS instructions or links to SPSS help pages sprinkled throughout. 

### Other
Link other notes and helper files such as how to do things in R, how to write posters, how to read journal articles here. Or in it's own folder below?
