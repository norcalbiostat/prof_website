When I'm not on campus, typically i'm growing :carrot::ear_of_rice::tomato::eggplant::green_apple: for my family, out adventuring with my :dog:ðŸ§”:poodle: , or getting some :video_game::game_die::books: time in. 

Campus life consists of: 

* [Teaching](#teaching) the next generation of Scientists how to harness the power of Statistics and Data in a responsible and ethical manner. 
* Providing Statistical consulting and analytical support for many [projects](#projects) on and off campus. 
* Supporting students in their academic adventures through intensive advising and [research](/students). 
* Leading the [Data Science Initative (DSI)](https://www.csuchico.edu/datascience/) to develop Data Science capacity on our campus.
