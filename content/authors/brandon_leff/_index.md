Hi, I'm Brandon. I am an undergraduate student at Chico State graduating in Spring 2021. My main interests in a professional sense are Biostatistics, Data Science, and Sports (Mostly Basketball). In my personal life I really enjoy competitive gaming and bowling. I have traveled all around California participating in youth bowling tournaments and have even competed at the state championships. I currently am a Data Science Intern at CHC in Chico and my main focuses are in CalFresh Outreach and SNAP-Ed. Feel free to email me or follow me on twitter if you have any questions both regarding my interests or anything else.

Fall '21 update: Brandon will be attending UC Davis for a MS in Statistics with a concentration in Data Science. 

## Projects

The Epidemic of Microtransactions on Mobile Gaming:

This project was my final portfolio for my Intro to Data Science course at Chico State. I wanted to focus on how microtransactions and virtual currency were affecting the app store and ways developers made games or apps.
