Hi everyone, I'm a graduate student in UCLA’s Master of Applied Statistics and Data Science (MASDS) program, with a B.S. in Statistics from Chico State. I’m passionate about using data to drive decision-making and tell meaningful stories, especially in areas like social impact, education, and health. I’ve worked with campus programs like CalFresh Outreach and Center for Healthy Communities (CHC) to develop Shiny dashboards, conduct evaluation research, and explore how internship experiences shape student outcomes.

Outside of data, I enjoy strength training, experimental music, and playing the guitar.

## Projects

CalFresh Outreach Sign-In Dashboard App

A Shiny app that visualizes student visits to Chico State’s CalFresh Outreach office. The dashboard filters by academic term, visit type, and assistance provided, giving staff an accessible and interactive way to understand service trends.
