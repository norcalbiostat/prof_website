Hi, I'm Emilee! I grew up in a small town called Corning, California where I still reside.  Upon completion of my master's degree, I plan to complete my dietetic internship and become a registered dietitian. I currently work for the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program in Shasta county and would like to continue my work with them as a registered dietitian in the future. I am also very interested in student success programs. Throughout my college career, I have worked for the Supplemental Instruction (SI) program at Chico State. In my current research, I am looking into the efficacy of the SI program at Chico State.  Please reach out to me by email if you have questions or would like to discuss any of my interests in further detail.

Updated Aug '21: Emilee successfully defended her Masters Thesis and will be submitting her work as a professional paper in the fall.
