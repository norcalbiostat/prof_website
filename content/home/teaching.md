And have created, curated, or contributed to the following teaching materials, most of which (textbook excepted) are licenced under [CC-BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). 

* [That book -->](https://www.routledge.com/Practical-Multivariate-Analysis/Afifi-May-Donatello-Clark/p/book/9781032088471)
* [Curated data sets](data/)
Wherever possible I try to use real world, non pre-processed data in the classroom. 
* [Applied Statistics Notebook](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/AppliedStatistics_notes/)
A compilation of Applied Statistics lecture notes using [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) that I use in multiple classes. Most of the examples are in R, some SPSS instructions or links to SPSS help pages sprinkled throughout.
