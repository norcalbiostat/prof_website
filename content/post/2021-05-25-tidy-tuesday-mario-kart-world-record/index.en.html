<p>I’m finally venturing into the world of <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">Tidy Tuesday</a>. This week is all about Mario Kart.</p>
<div id="the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>The Data</h2>
<p>The data this week comes from Mario Kart World Records and contains world records for the classic (if you’re a 90’s kid) racing game on the Nintendo 64.</p>
<p>This Video talks about the history of Mario Kart 64 World Records in greater detail. Despite it’s release back in 1996 (1997 in Europe and North America), it is still actiely played by many and new world records are achieved every month.</p>
<p>The game consists of 16 individual tracks and world records can be achieved for the fastest single lap or the fastest completed race (three laps). Also, through the years, players discovered shortcuts in many of the tracks. Fortunately, shortcut and non-shortcut world records are listed separately.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Nintendo 64 was released for NTSC- and PAL-systems. On PAL-systems, the game runs a little slower. All times in this dataset are PAL-times, but they can be converted back to NTSC-times.</p>

<div id="import-data" class="section level2">

<p>Variables of interest for me are <code>time</code> which is in seconds, and probably <code>type</code> for the type of track, and <code>shortcut</code> because times will be different if the player used a shortcut.</p>

<p>Skewed right.. large peak around 45s ish. Makes me wonder if there is one track that is played more often. I bet the different time “groups” are due to different tracks.</p>
<p>How many tracks are there?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table(records$track)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##

<p>16 - not too many.. Banshee Boardwalk and Bowser’s Castle don’t seem to be played much because they don’t have a lot of records. Or perhaps one person dominated the record board and noone can beat them. Not a high turnover world record.</p>

<p>Rainbow Road has the highest variability in record times. Three peaks, probably something to do with track type or shortcuts.</p>
<p>Going back to the original question, which track is the fastest, let’s just grab the minimum record time. Find the row with the minimum time.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>records[which(records$time == min(records$time)),]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 x 9
##   track       type    shortcut player system_played date       time_period  time
##   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Wario Stad~ Three ~ Yes      VAJ    NTSC          2020-07-30 14.59S       14.6
## # ... with 1 more variable: record_duration &lt;dbl&gt;</code></pre>
<p>That was a base R solution. Here is a ‘tidyverse’ solution.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>records %&gt;%
  arrange(time) %&gt;%
  slice(1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 x 9
##   track       type    shortcut player system_played date       time_period  time
##   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Wario Stad~ Three ~ Yes      VAJ    NTSC          2020-07-30 14.59S       14.6
## # ... with 1 more variable: record_duration &lt;dbl&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The fastest track time was on Wario Stadium, using a shortcut.</p>
<div id="side-tangent" class="section level3">
<h3>Side tangent</h3>
<p>What is the time distribution separated by shortcut?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(records, aes(y=time, x=shortcut, fill = shortcut)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_wrap(~track)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-05-25-tidy-tuesday-mario-kart-world-record/index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Shortcut doesn’t help Kalimari Desert…spread. The median is very different. Let’s look one more time at distribution, but switch to density so we can see overlap.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(records, aes(x=time, color = shortcut)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  facet_wrap(~track, scales = &quot;free&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2021-05-25-tidy-tuesday-mario-kart-world-record/index.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This also shows us that shortcuts were discovered on all tracks except:</p>
<ul>
<li>Banshee Boardwalk</li>
<li>Bowser’s Castle</li>
<li>Koopa Troopa Beach</li>
<li>Moo Moo Farm</li>

<p>Look at shortcuts vs not totally separately so that the panels can wrap and be more visible. Especially for <em>Penev</em>. I can’t see what they’re doing at all.</p>

<p>Things I noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s still two peaks for most maps, even though we’re looking at records that were won not using a shortcut. So there is something else going on that affects track time.</li>
<li>PENEV dominated Yoshi Valley</li>
<li>Only MR and PENEV play Toad’s Turnpike</li>
<li>There are 7 maps or so that don’t have high turnover with records.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s exactly what was driving the two distinct peaks for most if not all maps. That’s something we should have taken into consideration earlier on.</p>
